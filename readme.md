`cassak2017` and `liu2017` for 21 july 2021...

cassak2017
- simplified analytical description of the 2d reconnection
- examples are coming from solar flares, substorms, sawtooth, VTF & MMS
- quite large uncertainties associated to most quantities involved
- egedal measure 0.35 at VTF in 2007
- Sweet-Parker is ok as long as resistivity is high enough (S small enough)
- if S is too large, secondary islands...
- Petschek model is promising, but still need to identify the anomalous resistivity
- same rate in pair plasma where no Hall effect can develop
- 3 scenari : secondary islands, off-diagonal pressure tensor, weibel instability
- the 0.1 rate is also observed in HEDP numerical simulations
- the exhast velocity decrease when delta (thickness of rec layer) increases
- when opening the angle, the magnetic tension is counterbalanced by the pressure
- hence, rec rate decreases when opening the angle of the separatrices
- B field upstream of reconnection gets weaker...
- so it decreases the reconnection rate (slower exhaust)
- resistive reconnection for S below 10^4 (using length of current sheet)
- for larger S values, secondary islands with E'=0.01

liu2017
- emphasize the def of global, local and micro-scales
- rate 0.1 also observed in pair plasma & strong guide field where no Hall term
- address low-beta systems : small enough density upstream...
- so upstream magnetic pressure is balanced by downstream magnetic tension
- analytical model for upstream B field
- bell shaped curve for E', depending on aspect ratio, with max=0.2
- model of reconnection independent of dissipation mechanism







can we evaluate the resistivity of the media : slow or fast reconnection ?
considering that real resistivity could be larger than the Spitzer resistivity
is the upstream B field decreased in shamrock ?
is the downstream alfven velocity decreased in shamrock ?
if downstream density is increased (by accumulation) alfven velocity is decreased
is the reconnection electric field larger than the dreicer electric field (collisional ?)
problem of the very large scale and time of interaction ? no...
strong modification by 3d effects : not obvious...
are we in the low-beta approximation ?
