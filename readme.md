loureiro2007 :
- growth rate of the instability scales as S^{1/4}/L_{CS}
- nbr of plasmoids scales as S^{3/8} (S=10^12 in solar corona)
- petschek can be fast, but needs a inhomogeneous anomalous resistivity
- SP reconnection is observed (experiments and simulation) but too slow
- revisit resistivive tearing with perturbation k(t)= k_0 e{-\Gamma t}
- then obtaining the same system with "resistivity" replaced by k_0 and L_{CS}
- most unstable mode with wavelength well smaller than L_{CS}
- CS stable for aspect ratio < 100, that is S < 10^4

samtaney2009 :
- resistive MHD simulations associated to loureiro2007
- in nonlinear regime, plasmoids grow faster than they are ejected...
- hence the disruption of the current layer
- this quesiton the stationarity of the SP model
- S~10^8 in large tokamaks
- plasmoid reconnection can be a response to fast reconnection and non-thermal particle accelerationA
- no wave number initially favored and free outflow BC
- stationary for S < 10^4 (SP)

uzdensky2010 :
- global reconnection rate is independant of S
- finite probability of emergence of abnormally large plasmoids
- breakup of SP layer in plasmoids (secondary islands) for S > 10^4
- secondary plasmoids are the one embedded by 2 other plasmoids
- stretching of CS between 2 plasmoids, where plasmoid instability develops for L > critical one
- because ejection of plasmoid is slower than its growth rate : coalescence
- in SP : E'=S^{1/2}, so with S_{crit}=10^4, E'=0.01


daughton2012 :
- in resistive MHD, thickness exceed ion gyroradius and fast reconnection E'=0.01
- but formation of plasmoids may induce transition to kinetic regime with E'=0.1
- Petschek reconnection driven  by localized reconnection : otherwise, SP
- PIC simulation with Monte-Carlo treatment of the Fockker-Planck collision operator
- revisit previous results w. guide field
- resistive reconnection in large scale produce thin CS with kinetic reconnection
- collisional/collisionless transition for \delta ~ ion sound speed (inertial length w/o guide field)
- in collisional rec, rec electric field has to be smaller that the Dreicer runaway limit

ugai1977 :
- first runs with localized resisvitity for petschek


uzdensky2000 :
- evolution to SP even if initial state is petschek-like


shibata2001 :
- magnetic reconnection may proceed as a hierarchy of current-sheets and islands



can we evaluate the resistivity of the media : slow or fast reconnection ?
considering that real resistivity could be larger than the Spitzer resistivity
is the upstream B field decreased in shamrock ?
is the downstream alfven velocity decreased in shamrock ?
if downstream density is increased (by accumulation) alfven velocity is decreased
is the reconnection electric field larger than the dreicer electric field (collisional ?)
problem of the very large scale and time of interaction ? no...
strong modification by 3d effects : not obvious...
are we in the low-beta approximation ?
